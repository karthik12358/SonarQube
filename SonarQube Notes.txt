SonarQube by KK FUNDA
=====================


Explain the flow diagram ----> Before maven and tomcat ----> SonarQube.


Def:
---

-> SonarQube is an open-source platform used for continuous inspection of code quality. 

-> It performs static code analysis to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in your code.



Key Features
=============

Code Quality and Security
-------------------------

Bugs and Vulnerabilities ---> Detect and fix issues that might lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities.

Code Smells --> Identify maintainability issues in your code.

Code Coverage --> Measure how much of your code is covered by tests.

Duplication --> Detect duplicate code blocks.

Technical Debt --> Estimate the effort required to fix all the issues in the code.


Multi-Language Support
----------------------

Supports a wide range of programming languages including Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, Python, PHP, and many more.

what is the diff between code review and code coverage?
=========================================================

code coverage:
--------------

Number of lines tested through unit test cases called as code coverage.

In any project 80% need to satisfy.

Benefits: Helps identify untested areas of code

Tools: Tools like JaCoCo (for Java)



code review:
------------

Code review is the process of manually reviewing code by team members to find bugs, ensure to following  coding standards, and improve overall code quality.

Benefits: It Leads to better software quality, fewer bugs, and promotes best practices within the development team.

Tools: Code review tools include GitHub Pull Requests.

more information about SonarQube
---------------------------------

--> SonarQube previously called as a Sonar , It is open source software quality management tool.
--> It will continuosly analyze and measures quality of a source code.
--> In case any issues found, It will generate in html format/ PDF format reports.
--> It supports multiple languages like JAVA, c#, Java Script etc [Initially It was developed for JAVA]
--> It is supporting OS like mac,Linux, windows , etc
--> It will support multiple DBs like MYSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc
--> It will supports multile browsers like chrome, safari, IE, Microsoft edge, etc
--> It will identify the bwlow issues:
   1. Duplicate code
   2. Coding standards
   3. unit test cases

prerequsites for SonarQube Installation
=======================================


To install SonarQube, certain prerequisites must be met in terms of software and hardware requirements.

Below are the detailed prerequisites for installing SonarQube:

1. Hardware Requirements
------------------------
CPU: Modern multi-core processor.

RAM: At least 2GB of RAM (4GB recommended for production).  go for t2.medium

Disk Space: 1GB of free disk space for the SonarQube installation, plus additional space for the database.

2. Software Requirements
------------------------
Operating System
-----------------
Linux (preferred)
Windows
macOS

Java
----
Java JDK 11 or 17
SonarQube requires the Java JDK (not just the JRE).
Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK installation.

DB
--
Oracle
MYSQL  --> Removed
MS SQL SERVER
POSTGRE SQL 

DB is optional, Because of H2 is inbuild DB for SonarQube.




SonarQube installation
======================

step 1: launch t2.medium machine [4GB]

step 2: connect to that server

step 3: switch to root user [ sudo su - ]

step 4: install java

   sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel -y
  
   javac --version

step 5: go to /opt dir

  cd /opt

step 6: yum install wget unzip -y

step 7: wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-9.6.1.59531.zip

step 7.1 : unzip sonarqube-9.6.1.59531

step 8: mv sonarqube-9.6.1.59531 sonarqube

step 9: 
 As a good security practice, SonarQuber Server is not advised to run sonar service as a root user, so create a new user called sonar user  and grant sudo access to manage nexus services as follows.


useradd sonar

step 10: 

Give the sudo access to sonar user

visudo

sonar   ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

step 11:

Change the owner and group permissions to /opt/sonarqube/ directory.


chown -R sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube/
chmod -R 775 /opt/sonarqube/
su - sonar
cd /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/

sh sonar.sh start
sh sonar.sh status

in real time same permission are given to the file ?



step 12: Now you can try to access the SonarQube Server.

NOTE: default port number for Sonarqubr server: 9000

http://15.207.110.48:9000

NOTE: pls make sure to aloow traffic for 9000 port.

step 13: refresh the page

  default credentials:  uname: admin   pwd: kkfunda

stpe 14: It will ask to change the password


================================================================================================


Trouble shooting
=================
1. sonar user
2. traffic enabled or not
3. Java installed or not.


==============================================================================================

Realtime bug [Most of the people are facing same issues]
------------

If you are by mistake started sonarqube server with root user, Then it will not start the sonarqube server.

sudo su -
cd /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64

sh sonar.sh start ---> It is showing started , But actually it is not started.
sh sonar.sh status

--> try now with sonar user

su - sonar

cd /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64

sh sonar.sh start ---> It is showing started , But actually it is not started.
sh sonar.sh status

NOTE: when you are getting this error , Then check the logs once.

cd /opt/sonarqube/logs

cat sonar.log  ---> temp directory created


delete that dir:   sudo rm -rf /opt/sonarqube/temp/

sh sonar.sh start 
sh sonar.sh status
Then start the sonarqube server from sonar user and check the status.
http://13.233.55.221:9000/





================================================================================================

in build stage we are giving sonar details then it will generate reports....but this sonar pwd will expiry in months?  NO, But token will expire.









How to execute the sonarqube report for our java projects?
==========================================================

step 1: connect to the server , where your java projects are available.

step 2: update the pom.xml with sonarqube details.

        <properties>
                <sonar.host.url>http://43.205.231.25:9000</sonar.host.url>
                <sonar.login>admin</sonar.login>
                <sonar.password>kkfunda</sonar.password>

        </properties>
step 3: generate the sonarqube report

  mvn sonar:sonar    [pluginName:goalName] 


step 4: go to sonarqube server GUI , click on projects tab , where you can see the project.

step 5: Open the project to see complete report.











====================================================================================================

Requirement: Instead of user_name and password hard coded in pom.xml , How to use the SQ server token.

sol: 
step 1:

Goto adminstration --> security --> users --> click on tokens -->  Give the name --> click on generate---> copy [squ_cc48a3bf6387f56c0e7175f5a8ab99d63c0caa45] 

step 2:  squ_cc48a3bf6387f56c0e7175f5a8ab99d63c0caa45
update your token in pom.xml

  <properties>
                <sonar.host.url>http://43.205.231.25:9000</sonar.host.url>
                <!-- 
                <sonar.login>admin</sonar.login>
                <sonar.password>kkfunda</sonar.password> 
                -->
               <sonar.login>squ_cc48a3bf6387f56c0e7175f5a8ab99d63c0caa45</sonar.login>
    

     </properties>

step 3: Generate again:  mvn clean sonar:sonar


====================================================================================================
























How to change the sonarQuber server port number?
------------------------------------------------
--> Default port number is : 9000
--> Default context path: / 

step 1: goto  cd /opt/sonarqube/conf

step 2: vi sonar.properties  --> remove comment and add port and context path

    105  sonar.web.context=/kkfunda
    107  sonar.web.port=8639

step 3: /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64

step 4: sh sonar.sh restart



====================================================================================================

















Projects
---------
It displays all the projects.

issues
-------
It will diaplays all the project issues.

Rules
-----
For each programming language we have rules.

Quality Profile
---------------
-> Collection of rules , those can be applied during the sonarqube generation.
-> For each language one quality profile will be there

IQ] Is it possible to create a custom quality profile?
ANs: Yes

step 1: 

Quality profiles --> create --> name [jio-qp] --> language [java] --> Parent [none] --> save

step 2: 

Goto quality profile --> check under java --> It will be created.

step 3: Assign that quality profile to the project.

Go to project --> select project --> project settings --> quality profiles --> java change profile --> Always use specific quality profile --> save 


step 4: Now you can build : mvn clean sonar:sonar



quality gates
--------------
--> set of conditions

--> By default one quality gate is avaiable, i.e Sonar way

How to create a quality gate?
-----------------------------

step 1: 

Quality gates --> create --> name[jio-qg] -->save --> Add condition --> on overall code --> qg fails wahen --> coverage [80%] --> add --> 

Add condition --> on overall code --> qg fails wahen --> Duplicate lines [3%] --> add 


step 2:

Go to project --> select project --> project settings --> quality gate --> java change profile --> Always use specific quality gate --> save 

step 3: go and run the sonarqube report [mvn sonar:sonar]
















Adminstration
=============

configuration
-------------
languages --> selct different languages --> and see the extensions

security 
--------
security --> users --> create user --> give the details --> create 

--> Then login with new credentials.

How to give admin access to normal user?

--> login with admin --> security --> users --> give sonar-admin access to normal user --> click on groups--> select all --> give admin access --> then login with user details.

How to create a groups?

--> login with admin --> security -->
